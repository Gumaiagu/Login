# LOGIN project

The idea of this project is make a login site that sands you for another page.

## What uses

This project uses the React with TypeScript, I used the Vite as an installer.

## Challenges to me

This program was created as a chelenge to me, I am an iniciant in web programing, so I had some dificult to make it, like, when I needed to get a input value.

## What you can do with this

If you want, you can aprimorate this project, as I told in the `challenges to me`, I am an iniciant in web programing, so I think that this program isn't it's best possible.

If you're also an iniciant in it, you can study this project, but it isn't a professional project, ok.
